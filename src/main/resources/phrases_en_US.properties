QnHello.intro=Hi there! I understand a few simple commands: \
    "merge", "deploy", etc. \
    [This page](https://doc.rultor.com/basics.html) \
    explains them briefly. Any questions or bug reports \
    are [welcome](https://github.com/yegor256/rultor/issues). \
    Have fun :)

QnVersion.intro=My current version is %s, \
    Git revision is [`%s`](https://github.com/yegor256/rultor/commit/%2$s).

Reports.success=Done! FYI, the full log is [here](%s) (took me %[ms]s).
Reports.failure=Oops, I failed. You can see the full log [here](%s) (spent %[ms]s).
Reports.stop-fails=Sorry, I failed to stop the previous command, \
                   however, it has the following result:

CommentsTag.duplicate=Release `%s` already exists! I can't duplicate it, \
    but I posted a comment there. In the future, try to avoid duplicate releases.

QnByArchitect.denied=Thanks for your request; @%s please confirm this.
QnByArchitect.read-only=Unfortunately, either you or I don't have 'write' permissions \
  to the repository, so I can't do what you're asking. \
  Try to add me as a collaborator with 'write' access.

QnReferredTo.mentioned=I see you're talking about me, but I don't understand it. \
    If you want to say something to me directly, start a message with %s.

QnLock.response=I added `.rultor.lock` file to the `%s` branch. \
    From now on, only %s can merge anything into this branch. \
    In order to unlock the branch, say ``@rultor unlock branch is `%1$s```.
QnLock.already-exists=File `.rultor.lock` already exists in `%s` branch. \
    Try to unlock first, using ``@rultor unlock branch is `%1$s```` command.

QnUnlock.response=I removed `.rultor.lock` file from the `%s` branch.
QnUnlock.does-not-exist=File `.rultor.lock` doesn't exist in the `%s` branch.

QnIfUnlocked.denied=At the moment, you can't merge anything into "%s" branch. \
    Only one of them can: %s.

QnIamLost.response=I'm sorry, I don't understand you :( \
    Check [this page](https://doc.rultor.com/basics.html) and try again, please.

ClosePullRequest.explanation=Rultor closed this pull request for you because \
    your .rultor.yml specified the use of rebasing before merging. GitHub does \
    not mark rebased pull requests as merged, because rebasing entails a \
    change in commit hashes. Nevertheless, all your files have been merged \
    exactly as they would have been merged without the rebase option set.
